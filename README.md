# Rules for installing the project

 
## Introduction
A virtual environment is an isolated environment for Python projects, allowing you to manage dependencies for different projects separately. This README provides instructions on creating a virtual environment in both Linux and Windows.
 
## Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system (Python 3.3 or newer is required).
- `pip` installed (Python's package installer).
 
## Instructions

1. **Open a Terminal:**
   Open a terminal window on your Linux system.
 
2. **Install `virtualenv` (optional but recommended):**

3. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv myenv
4. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
