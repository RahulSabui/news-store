    "articleBody": "CoinDCX, one of the biggest rivals of crypto currency platform, WazirX seems not in sync with the '55/45 approach' that the platform has announced to deal with the hacking attack that saw almost half of its reserves getting stolen. On July 19, WazirX experienced a significant security breach, resulting in the loss of over $230 million worth of cryptocurrency assets. In response, WazirX announced on Saturday a controversial solution: distributing the loss among all customers. In a blog post last week, WazirX said that it is navigating the situation with transparency and fairness. \"This approach aims to distribute the financial impact across all users equitably. Unlike traditional recovery methods that can take years, this strategy offers a faster, more flexible solution by allowing immediate access to a significant portion of assets while maintaining the possibility of further recovery for those who choose to wait\" WazirX stated in the post. CoinDCX co-founder slams WazirX's approachSumit Gupta, cofounder of CoinDCX, expressed his concerns on X, formerly Twitter, urging WazirX to rethink its approach to managing the situation. \"Hate to be saying this, but the way @WazirXIndia is handling this entire situation isn't community first and this IMO won't go down well for them. This sadly is also hurting the other ecosystem participants. The first contribution to losses should ALWAYS come from the Company (i.e. WazirX in this case) and the treasury and assets the company holds. I have not seen any such commitment around this from the company side, instead making customers directly absorb the 45% losses is utter nonsense. The poll options are also framed in a manner to protect the business first and not the customers. Hopefully they will reconsider their approach and do what's right by the customers,\" wrote Gupta. He warned further that \"the incident could also negatively impact participation in the broader crypto ecosystem.\"WazirX's controversial solution to security hackWazirX's socialized loss strategy has not gone well with users on the platform. The cryptocurrency exchange is facing a huge backlash from social media users on its approach to deal with the hacking. Several users wrote that the company failed with the security and now wants the customer to pay the price.",

Previously, the maximum punishment was 10 years and a fine of Rs 50,000.Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Khanna introduced the bill in the House on Monday.

Many stopped to take photographs and selfies with the scrapped plane as traffic was hit on both flanks of the road on Monday.The scrapped Airbus A319 that was being transported from Kolkata airport to Faridabad in Haryana on a tractor trailer was the last of the consignment of five planes which had been retired. It had been purchased by Delhi-based firm Moni Ji Enterprises and was being ferried to north India. 112124248 The company buys scrap planes and turns them into restaurants, film shooting sets, installations at city landmarks, amusement parks and innovative office cabins.In the early hours of Monday, the tractor trailer with the plane fuselage on its deck was stopped at the entry point to the Vivekananda Setu next to Dakshineswar temple by traffic cops after the driver missed the diversion to take Nivedita Setu. While it was reversing, the trailer suffered a snag and got stranded. Following daylong deliberation with cops and attempts to repair the trailer, it was finally up for journey again by late on Monday evening.TOI had earlier written how another scrapped aircraft got stranded during the transportation to Amritsar \u00e2\u0080\u0094 2,000 kilometres away \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in March.

But remember, the people of India are not Abhimanyu, they are Arjun, they know how to answer your every atrocity by breaking the Chakravyuh,\" he added.Rahul's criticism followed a written reply in the Lok Sabha, which revealed that public sector banks collected around Rs 8,500 crore in penalties for not maintaining the average monthly minimum balance over five years starting from FY 2019-20. Pankaj Chaudhary, the minister of state in the finance ministry, also informed the Lok Sabha on Monday that state-run banks have charged depositors Rs 2,331 crore in penalties for the same reason in FY24.Rahul's comments come a day after he accused the NDA government in the Lok Sabha of trapping farmers, youth, soldiers, backward classes, and MSMEs in a vicious \"chakravyuh\" under Modi's regime. He expressed disappointment that the finance minister did not address farmers' demands for a legal guarantee on MSP and the caste census clamor.On Monday, Rahul used the \"chakravyuh\" theme, suggesting that the mythological episode from Kurukshetra was being re-enacted in the 21st century by a \"trap\" controlled by the PM, home minister, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, Gautam Adani, Mukesh Ambani, and NSA Ajit Doval.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Union Budget on July 23 in the Parliament, making significant announcements for Bihar and Andhra Pradesh.",

    "articleBody": "Two meteor showers are all set to light up the night sky on July 30 and July 31 and one can watch up to 25 meteors per hour depending on their location, as per the American Meteor Society. The Alpha Capricornids and the Southern Delta Aquariids will peak simultaneously. \"It's just an amazing coincidence,\" said Nicholas Moskovitz, a planetary astronomer at Lowell Observatory in Arizona, according to CNN.Having two meteor showers peak within 24 hours is \"a little bit unusual,\" Moskovitz told Live Science. \"But the idea of multiple showers being visible in a single night? Certainly not too uncommon.\"When and where to watchMeteor showers occur when Earth's orbit intersects a comet's path, causing the rocky debris left behind by the comet to burn up as it enters Earth's atmosphere. During this double meteor shower, Earth will cross the orbits of comet 96P/Machholz, causing the Southern Delta Aquariids to peak from July 29 to July 30, and comet 169P/NEAT, which creates the Alpha Capricornids peaking from July 30 to July 31.Wednesday night is the best time to view both showers, according to Robert Lunsford of the American Meteor Society. As the moon wanes, it loses about 8% illumination each night, which can hinder the visibility of fainter meteors. On Monday, the moon will be about 34% full, and on Wednesday it will be 16% full, according to Nasa's Daily Moon Guide. Best viewing conditionsThe double meteor shower will be best viewed in the Southern Hemisphere, where the radiant, or the apparent point from which the shower originates, will be almost overhead. However, people in the Northern Hemisphere can also see the meteor shower if they have a clear view of the southern horizon. Both meteor showers will continue until mid-August.\"Almost all meteor showers peak in the early morning hours between 2 and 4 am,\" Moskovitz said. \"So if you want to catch either one of these, your best chances of seeing meteors are to get to a dark site and do so after midnight.\"Viewing tipsBoth showers are best viewed with the naked eye. For other skywatching events this year, a new pair of binoculars or a good backyard telescope might be useful.The science behind meteor showersMeteor showers occur at regular intervals due to their predictable orbits around the sun. The intensity of these showers can vary annually, influenced by when comets release debris and the duration the debris has been in space. Predicting meteor showers is crucial for the safety of spacecraft and humans traveling in space, said Moskovitz, who leads the Lowell Observatory Cameras for All-Sky Meteor Surveillance (LO-CAMS), a network of cameras monitoring meteors.Southern Delta Aquariids and Alpha CapricornidsAt its peak, the Southern Delta Aquariids will display around 20 to 25 meteors per hour, compared to \"background\" meteor showers that typically show around five meteors per hour. The Southern Delta Aquariids will appear \"pretty faint,\" Moskovitz said. \"You really need to get to a dark site, away from lights and traffic, stay off your cell phones, let your eyes acclimate to the dark, and you may have a chance of seeing some of those faint objects.\"In contrast, the Alpha Capricornids are less frequent but often produce \"bright fireballs with bigger meteor chunks coming in, burning up, and getting brighter, making for a more spectacular show,\" Moskovitz explained. These bright meteors are composed of marble-sized particles, while the fainter meteors are usually grain-sized.",

    "name": "Morning bonhomie and a day of mixed signals in UP BJP",
    "articleBody": "LUCKNOW: After playing the face of 'defiance' within the UP BJP since the Lok Sabha poll debacle, Deputy chief ministers Keshav Prasad Maurya and Brijesh Pathak appeared on either side of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath as he chaired the BJP legislative party meeting held ahead of the State Assembly Monsoon Session on Monday.Both Maurya and Pathak have, until now, stayed away from quite a few key govt meetings that were presided over by the CM. Maurya had even skipped the Prayagraj division meeting of BJP MLAs convened by Yogi recently. On Monday, the two deputy CMs were not only seen sitting beside the CM for the first time after the Lok Sabha poll results but also shared the same frame when the CM was speaking to media persons in the morning.By the afternoon, however, it turned out to be a day of mixed political signals as Maurya, while speaking at the party's OBC Morcha event, reiterated his stand that 'it's the political party that wins elections and not any govt'.The CM reached the House about five minutes before the proceedings on the first day of the Monsoon session. Yogi went to the Opposition benches and exchanged greetings with the newly nominated Leader of Opposition in UP Vidhan Sabha, Mata Prasad Pandey, senior SP leaders Shivpal Yadav and others. The CM also met Raja Bhaiyya and his cabinet colleagues Om Prakash Rajbhar.Interestingly, several MLAs from the treasury benches touched Yogi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet to seek his blessings. Yogi was also seen interacting with the legislators in an informal manner and listening to them carefully. The picture-perfect moment that caught the attention of photographers and videographers was initially seen by observers as the cascading impact of the Delhi visit.However, barring one meeting of BJP organisation secretary BL Santosh and Yogi which became public, the CM and two deputy CMs' participation in BJP-ruled CMs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 meeting addressed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the CM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation in NITI Ayog meeting, no reports of any one-on-one or closed-door meetings between any leader connected to UP have come to the fore.The bonhomie later in the day looked like an opportunity to be on the politically right side as Maurya, during the OBC Morcha executive committee meet, again reiterated his earlier stand that the organisation was bigger than the govt. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is the political party which wins the elections and not any govt. Had that not been the case, the BJP would not have won the 2017 election despite there being no BJP govt in the state then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. He, however, also toed the earlier line of the CM and said that overconfidence led to defeat on several seats.Later in the day, he posted on X about his meeting with top police officials as the leader of Vidhan Parishad and stated that the DGP had been instructed to ensure people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s problems are heard in police stations and there was a check on corruption.While addressing the BJP working committee meeting members on July 14, the deputy CM said that his pain and that of the party workers were the same.

On the other hand, Yogi in his speech had said that overconfidence led to the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dismal show in the Lok Sabha polls 2024.Since then, there were reports that all was not well in the UP BJP. What gave weight to speculation was Maurya's meeting with BJP chief JP Nadda in Delhi a couple of days after the executive meeting. His meeting was followed by UP BJP chief Bhupendra Chaudhary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meeting with Nadda, Home Minister Amit Shah and PM Modi on the same day. ",

    "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: Batsmen hitting bowlers for long and big sixes is a common occurrence these days. Sometimes the ball lands in the crowd, sometimes out of the stadium.Invariably, the ball is most of the times thrown back if it lands amongst the spectators. The ball, deemed to be lost, is most of the times replaced when it lands outside the stadium.But have you ever seen a person not returning a match and walking away with it, and that too with utter disdain?Yes, the unthinkable happened during the Tamil Nadu Premier League 2024 clash between Chepauk Super Gillies and Siechem Madurai Panthers at the NPR College Ground in Dindigul last Sunday.A clip shared by Star Sports Tamil shows that a Siechem Madurai Panthers pacer bowled from the round the wicket and a left-handed Chepauk Super Gillies batter read the length, took one step out of the crease and smashed it over the mid-wicket fence.So good was the timing that the ball went all the way out of the ground and the cameras also zoomed in looking for the ball. The cameras show that a local man in a lungi and T-shirt is holding the ball. But to everyone's surprise, he is no mood to throw the ball back into the ground. Not just that, he expresses his anger at the players as if saying that he has had enough of the ball coming to him and he won't return it this time and then nonchalantly walks away with the ball, still shouting angrily towards the ground.Later the man is also shown relaxing on a 'charpoy' as if nothing had happened.&mdash; StarSportsTamil (@StarSportsTamil) As far as the match is concerned, Siechem Madurai Panthers beat Chepauk Super Gillies by 9 runs.",

The LoP had said that the budget has stabbed the middle class, which enthusiastically banged thalis when asked to do so by PM Modi. Gandhi also slammed the Centre over the internship announcement in the Budget in which the youths will get the opportunity to do internships in the top 500 companies of the country.In response to Gandhi's allegations, Goyal said, \"In every respect the 10 years of the UPA were a failed experiment, reflected a failed government, reflected a failed governance model. And brought the country and people of the country to their knees.\"The Union minister also accused the Congress-led UPA government of not even mentioning bringing in a legal guarantee for MSP in their budget speeches.\"In 2004, the then finance minister, P Chidambaram, is on record to say that he has inherited a strong economy. At that time, the growth rate was over eight per cent, inflation was around four per cent, foreign exchange reserves were robust, compared to the size of the economy at that point of time,\" he said.\"What did the UPA do in the 10 years when they were in government? I have read 10 speeches of the UPA government, never once has there been a mention of bringing in a legal guarantee for MSP. Never once did they speak about trying to uplift the poor by giving them free homes,\" he added. Goyal further accused the UPA government of leaving behind a fragile economy for Modi government. \"They left behind for PM Modi a fragile economy which the world looked down upon. They (Congress) left behind the country high fiscal deficits, high inflations, low growth, very low foreign exchange reserves,\" he said.Gandhi on Monday also attacked Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman for not mentioning the paper-leak issue in the Budget speech, which he said is the 'biggest issue affecting youth.' \"In the past 10 years, there have been 70 cases of paper leaks in the country,\" Rahul Gandhi alleged.Showing the poster of the traditional Halwa ceremony, held at the Ministry of Finance before the Budget session, LoP Rahul Gandhi said that 20 officers prepared the Budget of India.Sitharaman had presented the Union Budget on July 23 in the Parliament and made major announcements for Bihar and Andhra Pradesh.",

    "articleBody": "NEW DELHI: CBI on Monday submitted a comprehensive 200-page chargesheet against chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and five others after completing its probe into the alleged irregularities in the framing and implementation of Delhi Excise Policy 2021-22. The development took place 712 days after the agency had registered an FIR in the case and commenced its investigation. 112122673CBI also pressed charges against AAP MLA MLA Durgesh Pathak, Aurobindo Pharma's non-executive director Sarath Reddy, director of Buddy Retail Amit Arora, entrepreneur Ashish Mathur and hawala operator Vinod Chauhan without apprehending them.Asserting that the CM facilitated the irregularities by being the apex authority, CBI has alleged his direct involvement in the \"scam\" by claiming that he personally handed over the \"draft GOM\" (group of ministers) policy report at his residence to DANICS officer C Arvind. The IAS officer, who also served as secretary to former deputy CM Sisodia, has provided a judicial statement affirming that the report was given to him in March 2021 after Sisodia summoned him to the CM's residence. Final Chargesheet Has 'New Evidence'  The draft GoM report was the new excise policy that was allegedly manipulated to benefit the liquor cartel. The DANICS officer had also testified that AAP's communication in-charge, Vijay Nair, had brought a copy of the excise policy to be fed into a computer while Kejriwal was present there. 112122721The final chargesheet also contains new evidence, including mention of details from an iCloud account, sources said. The chargesheet alleges that K Kavitha, a Bharat Rashtra Samithi MP, and liquor businessman Magunta Reddy convened with Kejriwal on March 16, 2021, in his office at Delhi Secretariat. The chargesheet asserts that during this meeting, Reddy sought Kejriwal's support for his liquor business in Delhi by requesting modifications to the Delhi Excise Policy 2021-22 that was in the works.The chargesheet claims that Kejriwal pledged his support to Reddy and directed him to contact the accused, Kavitha, who was collaborating with his team on the formulation of the excise policy. CBI further alleges that Kejriwal instructed Reddy to provide financial contributions to his party, AAP.The central agency's chargesheet also mentions that certain individuals involved in the liquor business in south India paid advance kickbacks amounting to approximately Rs 100 crore to AAP politicians and other public servants through the co-accused. These kickbacks were allegedly paid to facilitate beneficial changes in the excise policy of 2021-22.The agency has claimed these kickbacks were subsequently returned to some conspirators from the South lobby out of the profit margins of wholesalers holding L-1 licences through various means, including the issuance of excess credit notes, bank transfers and outstanding amounts left in accounts of controlled companies.Additionally, CBI has alleged that a cartel was formed between the three stakeholders of the now-scrapped excise policy - liquor manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers - by violating provisions. The chargesheet emphasises that all the conspirators actively participated in achieving the illegal objectives of the said criminal conspiracy, resulting in substantial losses to the exchequer and undue benefits to the involved public servants and other accused parties.Citing statements of individuals engaged in campaign activities of AAP during the Goa elections, the agency has claimed that cash payments were made to them for roles like that of survey workers, area managers and assembly managers. These individuals and campaign-related activities were collectively managed by Vijay Nair, who has been arrested in this case, and Durgesh Pathak, an AAP MLA, who has also been charged by CBI.Hyderabad-based businessman Sarath Chandra Reddy was arrested by ED in November 2022. He turned approver in the case in June 2023 after he was granted bail on medical grounds. He has been charged too.Kejriwal was arrested by CBI on June 26 from Tihar Jail while he was lodged in judicial custody in a connected money laundering case filed by ED. He was arrested by ED on March 21 but was recently granted bail by a trial court in the money laundering case on June 20. However, the trial court's order was stayed by the high court. On July 12, Supreme Court granted interim bail to Kejriwal in the ED case.The excise policy was scrapped in 2022 after the Delhi LG ordered a CBI probe into alleged irregularities and corruption in the formulation and execution of the policy.",

Despite some improvement, World Triathlon reported that water quality in parts of the swim course remained above acceptable levels. Live Updates: Paris Olympics Day 4\"Despite the improvement of water quality levels over the last hours, the readings at some points of the swim course are still above the acceptable limits,\" World Triathlon was quoted by Reuters early on Tuesday. \"Paris 2024 and World Triathlon reiterate that their priority is the health of the athletes.\"If bacterial contamination remains high by Wednesday morning, both the men's and women's races may be further postponed to Friday, earmarked as the contingency day. Should water quality still be a concern on Friday, the swim leg will be removed, and the event will be converted into a duathlon. The mixed triathlon relay event, planned for August 5, has August 6 as its backup day.&mdash; worldtriathlon (@worldtriathlon) The Paris authorities have invested 1.4 billion euros ($1.51 billion) in wastewater infrastructure to mitigate sewage discharge into the Seine. This initiative aims to make the river swimmable, positioning it as a notable legacy of the Games. Earlier this month, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo even swam in the river to assure skeptics of its improved safety.Nonetheless, predicting water quality on race day has remained a challenge due to its variable nature. Rainfall significantly increases the levels of harmful bacteria such as E. coli and enterococci in the river. Seth Rider, one of the 55 triathletes entered in the men's race, described his unique preparation for potential bacteria exposure. \"We know that there's going to be some E. coli exposure, so I just try to increase my E. coli threshold by exposing myself to a bit of E. coli in your day-to-day life,\" the U.S. athlete said at a press conference on Saturday.The Olympic triathlon course was designed to showcase Paris's landmarks, with the Seine swim being a key feature. Athletes will begin the swimming segment from a pontoon next to the Alexandre III bridge. They will then cycle and run past iconic sites such as the Mus\u00c3\u00a9e d'Orsay and Grand Palais, finishing the race back at the starting point.
